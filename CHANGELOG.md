## [Unreleased]

### BREAKING
- Renamed the `RepeatMode` enum to `MediaRepeatMode` (values `none`/`single`/`all`)

### Added
- Swift Package Manager support for iOS (alongside CocoaPods); enable with `flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager`
- `MediaConfig.respectSafeArea` — inset the video below the status bar/notch via `SafeArea`
- `MediaConfig.immersiveLandscape` — hide the system status bar in landscape (restored on portrait/dispose)
- Media-notification artwork auto-generated from a video frame when `MediaItem.artworkUrl` is absent (iOS `AVAssetImageGenerator`, Android `MediaMetadataRetriever`)
- DRM wired end-to-end on Android (Widevine) and iOS (FairPlay)
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, linting, and analysis
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement
- Automated release workflow with semantic versioning

### Changed
- Minimum iOS version raised from 12.0 to 13.0 (Swift concurrency; Flutter 3.44 dropped iOS 12)

### Fixed
- iOS landscape video scaling — `AVPlayerLayer` now resizes correctly on rotation
- `boxFit` property changes now propagate to the native view
- Multi-instance `MethodChannel` routing (events delivered to the correct player instance)
- Native certificate-pinning enforcement on DRM license requests
- Secure storage no longer downgrades to plaintext
- `PlaybackState.bufferedPosition` restored
- Control widgets now cancel their stream subscriptions (no leaked subscriptions)
- HTTPS enforced for DRM license/media URLs
- Deprecated `Color.withOpacity()` replaced with `Color.withValues(alpha:)`
- Deprecated `WillPopScope` replaced with `PopScope`
- Deprecated `onPopInvoked` replaced with `onPopInvokedWithResult`
